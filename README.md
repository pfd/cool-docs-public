# Cool Docs public repo

This is the public repository for [Cool Docs](https://cooldocs.dev), the personal website of [@pfd](https://github.com/pfd). The site is built by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and uses Google's [Docsy](https://docsy.dev) theme. I try to keep the site updated with tips & tricks on Hugo, writing samples, and other nonsense.

Cool Docs is still a WIP and the main codebase is currently private. When it reaches version 0.1, I'll issue a release to this repo. In the meantime, if you have any questions or feedback for the creators of this site, please create an [issue](https://github.com/pfd/cool-docs-public/issues/new).
